"What excites me most about Rilla is the chance to be part of a once-in-a-generation company in its earliest, most defining stageâ€”where long hours, in-person collaboration, and uncompromising standards turn into outsized impact and exponential growth. I thrive in environments where intensity fuels innovation, and Iâ€™m energized by the idea of contributing to a culture that feels like the early days of Amazon or Apple, where every decision shapes the companyâ€™s trajectory. I want to help build that legacyâ€”and who knows, I could be the next Soham Parekh."

â€” and yes, I wrote that line myself. ðŸ˜‰
